# BracketsProject

Unity Version: 2019.4.

This project was developed between March 2020 and December 2020 by a four person team. We set out to create an atmospheric space exploration game, where the visual aesthetic and tone of the game were key elements of the design. This game was developed in Unity, and we've decided to hold off on any further development of the game.

My roles in this project have been:
	Sole Programmer and Lead Technical Artist
	Concept, Level and  Mechanics Design
